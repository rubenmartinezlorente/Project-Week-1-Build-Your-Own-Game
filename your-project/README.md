## Project Description
The hangman is a kids-game where you have to guess a secret word spelling letters in a random way. You have so many mistakes as the drawing of a hangman in pieces.
I choose the hangman because is a good beginning to code/programming in python using strings, lists, loops and regex. 

## Rules
The rules of the game are the following:

1st Rule:Secret name are designed for just 1 word.

2nd Rule:All secret names are written in lower case, although player can type in upper case if he wants (it is automatized process).

3rd rule: There are 3 levels of difficulty in function of how much mistakes has available. 

4th rule: A mistake is taken into accoun just when your fail(obvious)

## Workflow
The outline of the workflow is:
1. Welcome to the game.

2. Request the secret word to guess.

3. Request the level of difficulty.

4. Creation of list that combine each letter of the secret word with its position.

5. Define initial values and list for the loops.

6. Execute the game.
