# DESIGN OF THE STRUCTURE GAME FOR THE PROJECT 1 -HANGMAN-

- Strutures

    - A Master game declare a word (string) to begin the game. 

    - There is a dead body splitted up in so many parts as strings has the name used (not counted spaces).

    - Start the game asking for strings:
        * For each string player writes, it compares with a dictionary (name): if it is you can see always the letters you have unlocked.

        * If you have so many mistakes (your letter is not in the name's string), as the dead body's pieces, you are dead and game is over.

# BONUS EXTRA

- Difficulty level: 
    - easy mode: the dead body has the double of strings's name.

    - Normal mode: the dead body has the same number of the strings's name.

    - Difficult mode: the dead body has the half number of the string's name
- Visual concept:
    analyze the library 'turtle' to make some gif for each round.
